## 💀 Overview

MicroSwarm is a local, privacy-focused AI agent system that runs on your CPU/GPU. Unlike standard chatbots, it uses a **Heterogeneous Swarm Architecture**:
1.  **The Architect (Phi-3):** Plans, critiques, and organizes complex tasks.
2.  **The Engineer (Qwen 2.5 Coder):** Writes high-performance code.
3.  **Red Team Security:** Automatically audits generated code for vulnerabilities before execution.
4.  **Netrunner:** Connects to the live internet to fetch real-time data.

The system uses an **Evolutionary Genetic Algorithm** to spawn multiple code variants, test them in a sandbox, and evolve the best solution.

## ⚡ Key Features

### 🧠 The Core (C++ Backend)
* **Iterative Evolution:** Spawns multiple "species" of code solutions and selects the fittest based on unit tests.
* **Multi-Agent Debate:** Agents critique each other's plans before writing a single line of code.
* **Tool Forge:** The agent can write its own Python tools and save them to the `tools/` directory for future use.

### 🌐 Netrunner Uplink (Live Internet)
* Real-time web search capabilities using a robust Python bridge.
* Filters results for relevance and strips HTML clutter.
* **Privacy First:** Uses DuckDuckGo (No tracking).

### 🖥️ Omega Dashboard (Frontend)
* **Three Reality Themes:** Hacker (Matrix Green), Ninja (Monochrome), Dragon (Ember).
* **Real-time Telemetry:** Live graphs showing Architect, Evolution, and QA timing.
* **Voice Uplink:** Browser-based speech-to-text command input.

🛠️ Installation & Build
Prerequisites
C++ Compiler: MSVC (Windows) or GCC/Clang (Linux/Mac).

CMake: Version 3.10+.

Python: 3.10+ (for tools).

Git: To clone the repo.
git clone [https://github.com/namankanwar11/MicroSwarm.git](https://github.com/namankanwar11/MicroSwarm.git)
cd MicroSwarm

2. Install Python Dependencies
For the Netrunner tool to work:
pip install -U duckduckgo_search

Download Models
Download these (or similar) GGUF models and place them in the models/ folder:

Planner: Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf

Coder: Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf

Build the C++ Backend

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release

🚀 Usage
Run the Server:

PowerShell

# Windows Example
# Windows Example
.\Release\microswarm.exe ..\models\phi-3-mini-4k-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf ..\models\qwen2.5-coder-1.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf

Open the Dashboard: Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8080/dashboard.html

Command Examples:

"Write a Python script to scan for open ports."

(Netrunner): "Search for the latest LangChain documentation."

(Forge): "Create a tool named system_check.py that prints CPU info."

🛡️ "Red Team" Security
Every piece of code generated by the Swarm passes through a Red Team Audit. If the code contains dangerous patterns (e.g., uncontrolled file deletion, RCE vulnerabilities), the system will:

Flag the vulnerability.

Reject the code.

Force the Coder agent to rewrite it securely.
